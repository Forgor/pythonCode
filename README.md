## The Specification of this Project ##


<p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     
This specification is used to show the grammer of some python usage. There will be one hundred examples to help us to uderstand well. I will update this according to the  date I create them. Welcome to help me to check with it and if any question, please let me know in time.All the content are learned in the http://www.iplaypy.com/python-100/</p>

### 20181014(1) ###


<p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the first example, this is to count the number of the number 1 2 3 4 these can be selected three, which can form a three digits without repetition.</p>
<p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the main points as below:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1. the usage of the for loop <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2. the usage of the control output  <br />

### 20181016() ###
<p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the second example,This is to accomplish to calculate the salary according to the different turnover.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1. pay attention to the necessary ident.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2. try to the differernt solution to one question   <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3. I think we should learn the solution that the web provide after wo finsih the question ourselves. beacause I find it is a useful method to solve the problem. just as this time, I leann the for loop and assignment statement to achieve the function recursion   <br />
